# BaaTorrent
Here's the scenario, on a weekly basis, or maybe daily, heck even every minute, certain video files are released to the public, in the form of an RSS feed, that you need to check and then download via torrent.
These video files contain 1 Audio stream and 1 Subtitle Stream as well, which is nice.
Let's say you have a very particular program that can't use Subtitle Streams, so you have to run your video files through something like Handbrake to hardsub them.
Finally, maybe you also want to interpolate those video files into 60FPS, or not, maybe.
THEN BAATORRENT IS THE PROGRAM FOR YOU! WOOHOO!
